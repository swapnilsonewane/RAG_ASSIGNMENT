In that motion, Knight argues for dismissal of the Rule 10b-5 claim against it, and also argues that I should decline to exercise jurisdiction over any remaining state law claims. Both Knight and plaintiffs have inundated this court with filings related to Knight\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In addition to filing a response to Knight\u2019s motion, plaintiffs have also filed a Rule 56(f) affidavit, in which plaintiffs\u2019 counsel avers both that plaintiffs\u2019 response is adequate to defeat Knight\u2019s motion and that plaintiffs require additional discovery to adequately respond to Knight\u2019s motion. I have reviewed these submissions, and conclude that summary judgment is warranted here. Thus, Knight\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted.",

The Specialist Defendants are dealer/brokers charged with establishing the bid and offer prices for every option in a designated option class; this price is known as \u201cthe quote.\u201d Specialists fill orders by matching buyers\u2019 orders to purchase options with contra- side customer orders to sell options at the same price. In the event that there are no existing contra-side customer orders, specialists execute orders by buying or selling the designated option from their own proprietary account.",

Direct access customers, like Plaintiffs, utilize arbitrage trading strategies in an attempt to take advantage of price discrepancies in the options markets. For example, if a specialist\u2019s buy bid on one exchange is $5.00 and a specialist\u2019s sell bid on a different exchange for that same option is $4.90 on another exchange, Plaintiffs attempt to execute simultaneous orders to sell on the first exchange and buy on the second exchange to achieve a 10 percent profit per option, while incurring minimal risk. Plaintiffs claim that, like the direct access customers, specialists also profit from capitalizing on market anomalies. Specialists are able to realize significant profits from such \u201cspreads,\u201d if and when they are able to fill orders from their own proprietary accounts. However, because direct access customers purportedly have access to better information and technology than typical customers, they have cut substantially into the specialists\u2019 profits.",

Because In re Refco and the related appeal do not involve claims against a specialist, and in light of the difference between typical broker-dealers and specialists (as highlighted in the Finnerty cases), I do not find the argument presented by the SEC to be on point here. Plaintiffs point to an administrative settlement that the4 SEC reached with Finnerty on May 28, 2009 to support their argument generally that implied misrepresentations may form the basis for a securities fraud claim against a specialist. I do conclude that consideration of this administrative settlement is not appropriate. As Knight pointed out, such settlements are not precedent.

In the ensuing years, Macquarie did not discuss IMO 2020 in its public offering docu - ments. In February 2018, however, Macquarie announced a drop in the amount of storage contracted for use by its subsidiary due in part to the decline in the No. 6 fuel oil market. Macquarie\u2019s stock price fell 41%. In response, Moab Partners, L. P., sued Macquarie and various of- ficer defendants. Moab alleged, among other things, that Macquarie violated Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\u20135(b)\u2014which makes it unlawful to omit material facts in connection with buying or selling securities when that omissi on renders \u201cstatements made\u201d mis- leading\u2014because it had a duty to disclose the IMO 2020 informationunder Item 303 of SEC Regulation S\u2013K.",

This case turns on whether this second prohibition bars only half-truths or instead extends to pure omissions. A pure omission occurs when a speaker says nothing, in circumstances that do not give any particular meaning to that silence. Take the simplest example. If a company failsentirely to file an MD&A, th en the omission of particular information required in the MD&A has no special signifi- cance because no information was disclosed.

In the securities con- text as elsewhere, a forward -looking statement of risk can be misleading insofar as it implies that the relevant risk has not already come to fruition. The antifraud provisions of the securities laws prohibit half -truths , not just flat -out lies, and there is no exception to that principle for risk -factor statement s. B. In urging th is Court to adopt their proposed cat- egorical rule, petitioners asser t (Br. 21-22, 24) that no reasonable investor would understand a risk disclosure to say anything about past events or present conditions. But just as a statement of opinion can imply a proposi- 11 tion of fact, see Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Coun- cil Constr. Indus.

In 2015, it became public that a political -consulting firm called Cambridge Analytica had improperly obtained data on millions of Facebook us- ers and used the data to assist the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz . Meta required that Cambridge An- alytica delete the data, and Cambridge Analytica certified that it had. But Cambridge Analytica did not delete the data. Instead, Cambridge Analy tica retained and used the data to assist Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016. In 2018, when Cambridge Analytica\u2019s continued use of the data became known , Meta\u2019s stock price fell.

Judge Bumatay dissented in relevant part , concluding that no reasonable investor would interpret statements concerning the pro- spect of future business harm from data misuse as im- pliedly asserting that no data misuse had ever occurred. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision is deeply flawed , and this Court should now reverse . Item 105 of Regulation S -K requires the disclosure of \u201c risk\u201d\u2014that is, a possibility of future harm.

In light of the language of typical risk disclosures and their place in the broader context of a 10-K filing, n o reasonable investor would read such a statement as impliedly asserting anything about whether the triggering event has occurred in the past or whether such an occurrence created a present risk of harm to the company. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary rule would create disclosure obligations of the very sort this C ourt has re- jected; lead to over warning in SEC filing s; and encourage lawsuits alleging fraud by hindsight.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT A risk disclosure under Item 105 of SEC Regulation S-K is not false or misleading for purposes of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5(b) merely because a company does not dis- close whether the specified triggering event had occurred in the past or whether such an occurrence created a pre- sent risk of harm to the company . Meta\u2019s risk disclosures in its 2016 10- K filing were thus not misleading merely be- cause they omitted that Cambridge Analytica had previ- ously misused Facebook user data. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrar y approach to risk disclosures under Item 105 is erroneous, and its judgment should be reversed. 2 For convenience, this brief cites only the amended opinion. 15 A. A failure to disclose information is actionable un- der Section 10(b) and Rule 10b -5(b) only if the omission renders an affirmative statement misleading.",

Whether a statement is misleading is assessed using an objective standard , judged from the perspective of a reasonable in- vestor. With respect to ordinary risk disclosures under Item 105, a reasonable investor would understand them to be forward- looking and probabilistic in nature. Item 105 re- quires the disclosure of \u201crisk \u201d\u2014the possibility, but not certainty, of a loss. Risk disclosures thus inherently refer to harms that could materialize in the future. Risk disclo- sures usually warn of a risk of harm that \u201c could\u201d or \u201cmay \u201d occur from some triggering event \u2014language indicating the speaker is conveying only that there is some possibil- ity of the risk occurring in the future . A reasonable investor would not interpret such for- ward -looking, probabilistic statements as implicitly certi- fying that the triggering event identified had never oc-curred in the past and that the company faced no present risk of harm from such an occurrence .",

That is especially true when, in contrast to Item 105, other items in Regula- tion S -K expressly require the disclosure of information about previous or ongoing events . That is not to say that a risk disclosure under Item 105 can never be false or misleading. A risk disclosure may be false or misleading where the statement necessarily depends on the veracity of some e mbedded fact or opinion, or the nature of the risk is misstated. But the mere fact that a risk disclosure does not state whether the trigger- ing event had occurred in the past or whether the com-pany faced some present risk of harm from such an occur- rence does not render the statement misleading.

The Ninth Circuit\u2019s standard would also result in bloated risk disclosures that conflict with the provisions of 17 Item 105, make disclosures less useful to investors, and burden public companies. In order to avoid liability, com- panies would be incentivized to disclose all previous occur- rences of each triggering event identified in each risk dis- closure. That result would undermine Item 105\u2019s direc- tion that companies state risks \u201cconcisely.\u201d It would also make risk disclosures less useful tools for investors, who would be swamped w ith extraneous information.

What is more, th e Ninth Circuit\u2019s standard would invite plaintiffs to respond to unexpected stock drops by scouring the company\u2019s risk disclosures from the last few years, finding one that mentions a similar risk in the ab-stract without disclosing the specified triggering event, and claiming fraud. But the securities laws do not allow pleading fraud by hind sight. And permitting lawsuits such as this one to proceed would have enormous conse- quences for public companies, which often cannot afford to gambl e with the potential for ruinous liability. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s theory of falsity also precludes resort to statutory and common -law safe harbors. D.

There is no dispute that such a disclosure would be liter- ally false only if the risk warned of were not in fact a risk.

Risk Disclosures Under Item 105 Make No Implied Representations About A Company\u2019s Past Experiences Whether an omission renders a statement false or mis- leading depends on how a reasonable investor would un- derstand the statement in the context in which it was made.

The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach also blurs the line that this Court highlighted just months ago in Macquarie , supra , between nonactionable pure omissions and omis- sions that render an affirmative statement misleading (and thus actionable) . The Ninth Circuit reasoned that forward- looking \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d disclosures silently im- ply the absence of any previous incidents concerning the risk, which turns every pure omission of historical fact into a hook to argue that the omission \u201c create[d] an im- pression of a state of affairs that differ[ed] in a material way from the one that actually exist[ed] .\u201d Pet.

That approach, while ultimately flawed, certainly has more to recommend it than the Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach.

Defendants\u2019 decision to ignore the 2021 Order and ICC report s, and to wait un til June 2023 to begin reducing the Fund\u2019s holdings of Company A stock, caused significant harm to the Fund and its investors. 110.
